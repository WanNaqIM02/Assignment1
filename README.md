## Design Process
---
The website is designed to showcase the works and projects done to potential employers and clients easily and professionally. Hence, also link my LinkedIN profile and email the the website so that i can be contacted by them easily.

The first part of design process will be outlining the purpose and functionality of my website in this README document. Then proceed to mock up the layout of this website through the use of the Adobe XD application. Hence, i need to ensure that my layout of my website could be navigated easily and that the content and text of the website is readable by the user. Once this is ensured, i would proceed to code and implement the content through the use of the Visual Studio Code intergrated development environment software in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to th implement the functionalilty of the website and intergrate the content such as videos and image into it. I will also use CSS to format and edit the content, text and appearance of the website thus to make it aesthetically appealing and professional.
