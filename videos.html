                <div><p class = "video-description">This game is developed as an individual project. Hence, I made the game into a playable and aesthetically pleasing game. Here's some the modifications I made to the game : programming the bars for the player's health and ammo, made the main menu for the game and programmed the options menu for the player to adjust the game according to their hardware's specifications.  Most of the 3-D environmental assets in the game were modeled with Blender. The player and the zombies characters were obtained from the Unity Asset Store. The animations were programmed by me to make the player and zombies animated during movement. The trailer for this game was created and edited with the use of Adobe Premier Pro.</p></div>

                <div><p class = "video-description">This game is developed by my classmates and I. This game is Dark Souls inspired side scrolling action game. Hence, this game requires the player to move from one end to another end by defeating the enemies while upgrading their stats such their magic abilities and health. Therefore, in this development for this game, my role consist of mostly level building and designing and creating the background for the game. I also did programming such as the user interface like the main menu for the game.</p></div>

                <div><p class = "video-description">Another individual project of mine, i created a top down shooter in which I programmed player to be able to move and rotate with both the W-key and Mouse. Inspirations for this game is the zombie mode of  Call of Duty and the artwork of Hotline Miami. I created the trailer for this game by recording a game play of it and editing by adding captions and slides to the video.  Hence, the assets of the game was created on a 2-D pixel creation website, Piskel in which I created the player character, Zombie characters and the props such as tables.  I also implemented a wave system for the game in which the player have to waves of zombies while having  intervals for the player to heal up and replenish their ammo.</p></div>
